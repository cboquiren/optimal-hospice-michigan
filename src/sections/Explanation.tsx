        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4 font-medium">
          Hospice care focuses on comfort rather than cure for individuals with a life-limiting
          illness. Care is provided by an interdisciplinary team and is tailored to meet the
          physical, emotional, psychosocial, and spiritual needs of each patient and family.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed font-medium">
          Hospice services are available wherever the patient calls home.
