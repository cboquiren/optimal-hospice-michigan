          What Is Hospice Care?
        </h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed max-w-4xl text-text-primary mb-4">
          Hospice care is specialized medical care focused on comfort, dignity, and quality of life
          for individuals facing a life-limiting illness. Rather than pursuing curative treatment,
          hospice emphasizes relief from pain and distressing symptoms while supporting emotional,
          psychosocial, and spiritual well-being.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed max-w-4xl text-text-primary">
          Care is provided by an interdisciplinary team of healthcare professionals who work closely
          with the patient, family, and attending physician to create a personalized plan of care.
          This team approach ensures that each patient’s unique needs, values, and preferences are
          respected at every stage of care.
